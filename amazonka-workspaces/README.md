## Description

Amazon WorkSpaces offers you an easy way to provide a cloud-based desktop
experience to your end-users. You simply select from a choice of bundles that
offer a range of different amounts of CPU, memory, storage, and a choice of
applications. Users can connect from a PC, Mac desktop computer, iPad,
Kindle, or Android tablet.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-workspaces)
